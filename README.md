# High-Scale Voting System Architecture

## Overview

Design for a global voting platform serving **300M users** with **250K requests/second**, ensuring zero vote loss even with poor connectivity.

---

## 1. Frontend Framework

### Recommended: Next.js + React

**Best for:**

- Static site generation with edge rendering
- Large ecosystem and familiar developer experience
- Seamless CDN integration

**Key Benefits:**

- Pre-rendered pages served globally from edge
- Edge functions handle auth and anti-bot checks
- Excellent tooling and community support

**Trade-off:** Slightly larger bundle size than alternatives, requires careful code-splitting for mobile

---

### Alternative: SvelteKit

**Best for:** Maximum performance on low-end devices

**Key Benefits:**

- Minimal JavaScript bundle (faster load times)
- Simple reactivity model
- Lower CPU usage on mobile

**Trade-off:** Smaller ecosystem and fewer enterprise integrations

## 2. Reliability: Never Lose a Vote

### Core Strategy

Guarantee vote delivery regardless of network conditions through local persistence and automatic retry.

### Implementation

**Technologies:**

- Service Workers with Background Sync
- IndexedDB for local storage
- UUID + signatures for idempotent requests

**Flow:**

1. User votes → generate unique `voteId` + cryptographic signature
2. Store locally in IndexedDB (status: `pending`)
3. Attempt API submission
4. On success: mark as `confirmed`
5. On failure: Service Worker automatically retries when online
6. Idempotent `voteId` prevents duplicates

**User Experience:**

- Instant feedback with "pending" indicator
- Automatic background sync
- Clear confirmation when submitted

## 3. Global Scale Architecture

### Edge-First Design

**Static Assets:**

- All pages pre-rendered and cached at 300+ global edge locations
- Sub-second load times worldwide
- Zero origin server hits for static content

**Edge Compute:**

- Authentication runs at edge (not origin)
- Bot detection near users
- Token generation with minimal latency

**Smart Client Retry:**

- Exponential backoff prevents reconnection storms
- Client-side rate limiting
- Delta updates only (not full reloads)

### Real-Time Updates

**Broadcast Strategy:**

- Cloudflare Channels for live vote counts
- WebSocket connections for active sessions only
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) fallback

## 4. Technology Stack

| Component       | Technology                 | Purpose                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Framework**   | Next.js                    | Static generation + routing     |
| **Hosting**     | Cloudflare Pages           | Global CDN edge hosting         |
| **Edge Logic**  | Cloudflare Workers         | Auth, validation, bot filtering |
| **Persistence** | Service Worker + IndexedDB | Offline support + retry         |
| **Real-Time**   | Cloudflare Channels        | Live vote broadcasting          |

## 5. Why Cloudflare Over AWS?

### Edge Performance

| Feature          | Cloudflare Workers        | AWS Lambda@Edge              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Startup time** | < 5ms (no cold starts)    | 100-300ms cold starts        |
| **Coverage**     | Compute at all 300+ edges | Limited edge compute regions |
| **Deployment**   | Instant (seconds)         | Slow (minutes)               |
| **Runtime**      | V8 isolates (lightweight) | Full Node.js (heavier)       |

### Real-Time Capabilities

| Feature         | Cloudflare              | AWS                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **WebSockets**  | Built-in, simple setup  | API Gateway (complex setup)  |
| **Scale**       | Proven at Discord scale | High scale but costly        |
| **Ease of use** | Drop-in solution        | Requires IAM + configuration |

### Key Advantages

**Cloudflare:**

- Faster edge compute (no cold starts)
- Simpler real-time setup
- Lower latency globally
- Instant deployments

**AWS:**

- Better for complex server-side logic
- More enterprise integrations
- Higher operational complexity
